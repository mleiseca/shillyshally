- reporting for work done
 - it would be neat if it could display bars per ticket showing how much time spent
 
- lock screen shortcut to stop timer?
 - The best I've found to to use a NSTask to launch and terminate ScreenSaverEngine. When terminated, without -background, ScreenSaverEngine will stop to prompt for a password if the user has configured their system to do so.

- add project deadline
- add task priority

- project inactive button 
 -> should only work if no active tasks exist for that project
 -> if there are no active tasks, it should remove project from list and mark it as inactive


- timeout style break timing
- screen overlay example: FunkyOverlayWindow

- how do you retain user preference information
 -> so that windows open in the same place?
 -> so that table columns retain their adjusted size?

- if you are making data model changes, how do you migrate the changes?

- maybe display seconds for currently running task?

How do I get undo/redo for free in my non-document-architecture-based app?
In a Core Data document-based application, the standard NSDocument undo manager is replaced by the document’s managed object context’s undo manager. In a non-document-based application for desktop Mac OS X, your window’s delegate can supply the managed object context’s undo manager using the windowWillReturnUndoManager: delegate method. If your window delegate has an accessor method for the managed object context (as is the case if you use the Core Data Application template), your implementation of windowWillReturnUndoManager: might be as follows.
- (NSUndoManager *)windowWillReturnUndoManager:(NSWindow *)sender {
    return [[self managedObjectContext] undoManager];
}

- "done" with running task doesn't stop timer
- change dock/tab icon depending on state (ie, working = green clock, not working = red clock)

- copy row in table: (ie, when row is selected, hitting command-c will copy a nicely formatted commit message with hours estimate and ticket)
  - subclass table view (http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/115492-copy-paste-in-nstableview.html)
  - - (IBAction) copy:(id)sender {
		NSLog(@"Copy");
	}


- adding project support
 -> shortcut for project dropdown in table?

- add groups for tasks
 -> this requires a screen to enter groups / manage reference data
