- reporting for work done

- timeout style break timing
- screen overlay example: FunkyOverlayWindow

- how do you retain user preference information so that windows open in the same place?

- if you are making data model changes, how do you migrate the changes?

- maybe display seconds for currently running task?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- "done" with running task doesn't stop timer
- change dock/tab icon depending on state (ie, working = green clock, not working = red clock)

- copy row in table: (ie, when row is selected, hitting command-c will copy a nicely formatted commit message with hours estimate and ticket)
  - subclass table view (http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/115492-copy-paste-in-nstableview.html)
  - - (IBAction) copy:(id)sender {
		NSLog(@"Copy");
	}


- adding project support
 -> shortcut for project dropdown in table?

- add groups for tasks
 -> this requires a screen to enter groups / manage reference data
