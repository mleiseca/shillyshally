- copy row in table: (ie, when row is selected, hitting command-c will copy a nicely formatted commit message with hours estimate and ticket)
  - subclass table view (http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/115492-copy-paste-in-nstableview.html)
  - - (IBAction) copy:(id)sender {
		NSLog(@"Copy");
	}

- timeout style break timing
- reporting for work done
- "done" with running task doesn't stop timer
- maybe display seconds for currently running task?
- change dock/tab icon depending on state (ie, working = green clock, not working = red clock)
- add groups for tasks
 -> this requires a screen to enter groups / manage reference data
- screen overlay example: FunkyOverlayWindow
- how do you retain user preference information so that windows open in the same place?
